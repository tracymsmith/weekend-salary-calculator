PROJECT NAME:  JS SALARY CALCULATOR

DESCRIPTION:
    Duration:  1 week
    Challenged to create an application to record employee salaries and add total salaries to report monthly costs.
    Utilized Javascript, Node, VS Code and Google Chrome to build application with input fields, table, submit and delete
    buttons and functions to enter and/or delete employee information that pushed to table plus calculate
    and compare total annual salaries to monthly salaries budget amount. Added functionality to issue alerts
    if/when total annual salaries exceeded monthly salary budget limit. Further functions included clearing input fields
    upon clicking submit button; removing employee data with delete button as well as removing deleted employee salary
    from total salary amounts; writing function to dynamically calculate and display on DOM sum of employee annual salaries
    as entered; convert annual salaries to monthly salary amounts; compare total monthly salary amounts to monthly budget
    limit and issue visible alerts on DOM if over budget.
